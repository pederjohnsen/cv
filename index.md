## Currently
Looking for a great team to join for my next role.

## Work Experience
`2015 - 2022`
__Software Developer at Ayoa (previously DropTask)__

I mostly worked on front-end, but tackled back-end whenever required or when taking the lead on brand new features.

I was working on the web/api side of things until around 2018 when asked if I wanted to be part of the team re-building our native Android app in __React Native__, I happily agreed as React Native was something I had been looking to learn at the time.
I later took over as the lead developer on that when the other developer left the company in 2020.

We eventually brought in some contractors to help with React Native development for a specific feature and to move the iOS app to React Native.
At this point I mostly lead the team and reviewed PRs while doing most of my coding work on the web/api side.

Regularly helped customer service team with __tech support__ tickets from customers.

__Some projects I worked on:__

___Account microservice___

I lead the initial development of the account microservice where users can edit their profile, change their password, update notification settings and manage their subscription.

___React Native___

I joined the newly created RN team with another developer to re-build our native Android app in __React Native__.
My responsibilities included working on building new components and reviewing the other developers pull requests.

___Push for React.js___

At the time we were adding an emoji picker to React Native it made more sense to move our existing web emoji picker to the one I ported to React Native: emoji-mart. I was already trying to get us to move to React.js as while working on React Native I got interested in learning React.js and this gave me the perfect opportunity to get it through the door.

After this we continued to write new components in React.js and slowly rewrite older components.

___Pulse___

I was the sole developer of the feature "Pulse", which I built on top of our existing Chat feature.
As the Pulse members needed to be based off the team subscription members I had to make sure they were properly synced, so if anyone were added/removed to the team, it would be reflected in the Pulse chat.

___Board Chats___

I was the sole developer of "Board chats" which I built on top of our existing Chat feature.
It would allow users to create a group chat tied to a board.

As with Pulse, the members of a board chat is based off who's on the board, so I had to make sure they were properly synced here too.

___Whiteboards___

I helped lead a team of up to 3 developers to bring our in development "Whiteboards" feature onto React Native.

Responsibilities included overseeing the progress, reviewing pull requests and co-mentoring our native iOS dev.

___React Native iOS___

Not long after the native iOS team shrunk to one developer, we decided it was a good idea to move our iOS apps over to React Native too.
I helped lead a team of up to 3 developers to bring the React Native app up to the standards of our existing native iOS apps to prevent negative feedback when released.

Responsibilities included overseeing the progress, reviewing pull requests and co-mentoring our native iOS dev.

___React Native iPad support___

After releasing our React Native app on iOS for iPhones we wanted to replace our iPad app too.
The larger screens meant our existing components looked too small, so we had to find a nice way to scale everything when the app is used on iPads. There were also other parts of our app that just didn't work great on a larger screen that we had to fix.

Responsibilities included overseeing the progress, reviewing pull requests as well as doing some of the work, like adding scaling.

__Tech used:__

- Front-end initially written in __CoffeeScript__ with __backbone.js__ then later we used __React.js__ for new components and to slowly rewrite old ones.
- Back-end written in __CoffeeScript__ with __node.js__/__express.js__ as __microservices__.
- Android and iOS written in __React Native__ with __TypeScript__ (originally using __babel.js__).

`2006 - 2015`
__Freelancing__

Between 2006 and 2015 I was doing freelancing on and off mostly using __PHP__ and some __node.js__.

`2014-2015`
__Retail at Lidl UK__

Most of my time at Lidl was spent at night shifts doing re-stocking.

`2009`
__Retail at Rema 1000 (Norway)__

## Personal Projects
`2018 - now`
__[Emoji Mart Native](https://github.com/tunoltd/emoji-mart-native), a React Native port of [emoji-mart](https://github.com/missive/emoji-mart/tree/v3.0.1)__

While working at Ayoa we required an emoji picker for the React Native app, so in my free time I decided to __port__ [emoji-mart](https://github.com/missive/emoji-mart/tree/v3.0.1) to __React Native__ which I continue to maintain and update to this day.

`2006 - now`
__Other projects__

I've also built multiple other personal projects throughout the years, mostly using __PHP__ or __node.js__, but all have since been shut down.
I am however thinking of starting to tinker with some of my existing app ideas I've yet to start.

## Hobbies
- __Learning__, playing and __experimenting__ with musical instruments.
- Developing, playing and collecting games from retro to modern.
