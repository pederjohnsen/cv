## Currently
Looking for a great team to join for my next role.

## Work Experience
`2015 - 2022`
__Software Developer at Ayoa (previously DropTask)__

I mostly worked on the front-end, but tackled back-end whenever required or when taking the lead on brand new features.
Was part of a 2 man team re-building the native Android app using React Native in 2018,
I later took over as the lead developer on that and in late 2021 we replaced the native iOS apps with React Native.

Regularly helped customer service team with tech support tickets from customers.

___Tech used:___

- Front-end originally written in CoffeeScript with backbone.js, but I later initiated the use of React.js and started writing new and rewriting old features in React.
- Back-end written in CoffeeScript with node.js/express.js as microservices.
- Android and iOS written in React Native with TypeScript (originally using babel.js).

`2006 - 2015`
__Freelancing__

Between 2006 and 2015 I was doing freelancing on and off mostly using __PHP__ and some __node.js__.

`2009`
__Retail at Rema 1000 (Norway)__

`2014-2015`
__Retail at Lidl UK__

Most of my time at Lidl was spent at night shifts doing re-stocking.

## Personal Projects
`2018 - now`
__[Emoji Mart Native](https://github.com/tunoltd/emoji-mart-native), a React Native port of [`emoji-mart`](https://github.com/missive/emoji-mart/tree/v3.0.1)__

While working at Ayoa we required an emoji picker for the React Native app, so in my free time I decided to port [`emoji-mart`](https://github.com/missive/emoji-mart/tree/v3.0.1) to React Native which I continue to maintain and update to this day.

`2006 - now`
__Other projects__

I've also built multiple other personal projects throughout the years, mostly using PHP or node.js, but all have since been shut down.
I am however thinking of starting to tinker with some of my existing app ideas I've yet to start.

## Hobbies & Interests
- Learning, playing and experimenting with musical instruments.
- Developing, playing and collecting games from retro to modern.
