## Currently
Looking for a great team to join for my next role.

## Work Experience
`2015 - 2022`
__Software Developer at Ayoa (previously DropTask)__

I mostly worked on the front-end, but tackled back-end whenever required or when taking the lead on brand new features.
Was part of a 2 man team re-building the native Android app using __React Native__ in 2018,
I later took over as the lead developer on that and in late 2021 we replaced the native iOS apps with __React Native__.

Regularly helped customer service team with __tech support__ tickets from customers.

___Tech used:___

- Front-end originally written in __CoffeeScript__ with __backbone.js__, but I later initiated the use of __React.js__ and started writing new and rewriting old features in React.
- Back-end written in __CoffeeScript__ with __node.js__/__express.js__ as __microservices__.
- Android and iOS written in __React Native__ with __TypeScript__ (originally using __babel.js__).

`2006 - 2015`
__Freelancing__

Between 2006 and 2015 I was doing freelancing on and off mostly using __PHP__ and some __node.js__.

`2014-2015`
__Retail at Lidl UK__

Most of my time at Lidl was spent at night shifts doing re-stocking.

`2009`
__Retail at Rema 1000 (Norway)__

## Personal Projects
`2018 - now`
__[Emoji Mart Native](https://github.com/tunoltd/emoji-mart-native), a React Native port of [`emoji-mart`](https://github.com/missive/emoji-mart/tree/v3.0.1)__

While working at Ayoa we required an emoji picker for the React Native app, so in my free time I decided to __port__ [`emoji-mart`](https://github.com/missive/emoji-mart/tree/v3.0.1) to __React Native__ which I continue to maintain and update to this day.

`2006 - now`
__Other projects__

I've also built multiple other personal projects throughout the years, mostly using __PHP__ or __node.js__, but all have since been shut down.
I am however thinking of starting to tinker with some of my existing app ideas I've yet to start.

## Hobbies & Interests
- __Learning__, playing and __experimenting__ with musical instruments.
- Developing, playing and collecting games from retro to modern.
